PROBLEM:
ATM INTERFACE
=========================
The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them.
It is a console-based application with five different classes. 
In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts.
Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:

*Transactions History
*Withdraw
*Deposit
*Transfer
*Quit

SOURCE CODE:
=============================
import time
print("please insert your CARD")
time.sleep(5)
password=1234
pin=int(input("enter your ATM pin: "))
balance=5000
if pin==password:
    while True :
    
        print("""
              1==balance 
              2==withdraw balance 
              3==deposite balance 
              4==exit
              """
              )
        
        try:
         option=int(input("please enter your choice: "))
        except:
         print("please enter valid option: ")
        if option==1:
            print(f"your current balance is: {balance}")
        if option==2:
            withdraw_amount=int(input("please enter withdraw_amount: "))
            if withdraw_amount>balance:
                print(f"insufficient balance")
            else:
